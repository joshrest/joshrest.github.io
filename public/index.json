This is a fundamental question in biology that has been extremely difficult to answer. My lab is working to answer to this question by using new technologies and novel approaches to examine how genes, transcripts, proteins, and cellular circuits enable survival. The goal of our research is to uncover the dramatic variation in the strategies cells use to survive, and to reveal the extent that cellular circuits vary in their response to changing environments. In order to make such inferences, some components of our work also require a good understanding of the population and phylogenetic history of genes and organisms. I have substantial experience in transcriptomics and computational biology. I have particularly focused on the use of transcriptomes for detecting horizontal gene transfer, inferring population and coalescent processes, and synthesizing results from transcriptomic data across research studies. Recently, a component of my work has focused on inferring processes that govern levels of natural variation and modes of evolution in regulatory and metabolic phenotypes. This work involves network level data (protein interaction, metabolic, and regulatory), gene expression data, whole-genome or transcriptome sequencing data, and/or large-scale phenotypic data. In the wet lab, we have prepared RNA-seq libraries from yeast, plants, and insects. We have developed an in-house pipeline to process and quantify the results of RNA-seq experiments.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1588339038,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://phylogenetic.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Download Rest\u0026rsquo;s CV \nRest is also director of the M.A. program in Ecology and Evolution.

There is an unexpectedly high level of cell-to-cell variation in the expression level of several hundred genes, leading to the question: What is the purpose of this heterogeneity? In work funding by NIH - NIGMS, My lab has developed an innovative approach that allows us to assess the consequences of cell-to-cell expression variation for many genes across thousands of budding yeast cells. We have found that for almost all genes, cells in the population that have extremely high or extremely low levels of expression show both slower growth rate and lower levels of survival than the majority of the population. This indicates that expression variation creates fundamental physiological differences among cells which will influence the growth and survival of the population. Preliminary results also show that the growth costs of outliers are exaggerated when they are away from the rest of the population, suggesting interactions among cells with different expression levels. In order to examine the evolutionary and population genetic consequences of this noise, we are examining these noise phenotypes across diverse wild isolates of budding yeast.\n","date":1587819313,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587841973,"objectID":"f4fc707a4358e78420264f49629b5220","permalink":"https://phylogenetic.com/project/cell-variation/","publishdate":"2020-04-25T08:55:13-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/cell-variation/","section":"project","summary":"Does the distribution of protein expression levels vary and evolve?

The three were among more than 100 scientists spanning 41 research groups across the globe who collaborated on the development of genetic tools in 39 evolutionarily diverse unicellular marine eukaryotes (protists). Their paper, Genetic Tool Development in Marine Protists: Emerging Model Organisms for Experimental Cell Biology, appears in the April issue of Nature Methods and was referred to by one of the paper’s reviewers as “a great resource that will be used for years to come as an authoritative encyclopedia of genetic manipulation of protists.”\nThese genetic tools are the primary means in which an understudied and generally underappreciated marine microbe emerges into a model organism. Expanding the evolutionary as well as the ecological breadth of diverse eukaryotes that can undergo genetic modification creates the foundation for questions regarding eukaryotic cell biology, evolution, ecology, metabolism, reproduction, etc. to be addressed head on. These eukaryotes play an enormous role in the ocean’s biogeochemical cycling and are an integral component of marine food webs. See the full press release.
